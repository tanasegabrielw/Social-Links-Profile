## My process

1. Make a github repository for the project
2. Get all the needed files inside the repository
3. Consult the desired preview
4. Draw the structure of the website on paper
5. Break down the parts of the website into smaller bits
6. Build the HTML structure of the page
7. Style each section using CSS
8. Fix and refine smaller details

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. How to position a footer at the bottom of the page while having a container. To do so, I wraped the container inside another div to properly use flex:1 without
the letting the container to grow all the way down.
