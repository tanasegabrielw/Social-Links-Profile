## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Project time limit of 2 hours (Done in 60 minutes)

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

1. Make a github repository for the project
2. Get all the needed files inside the repository
3. Consult the desired preview
4. Draw the structure of the website on paper
5. Break down the parts of the website into smaller bits
6. Build the HTML structure of the page
7. Style each section using CSS
8. Fix and refine smaller details

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. How to position a footer at the bottom of the page while having a container. To do so, I wraped the container inside another div to properly use flex:1 without
the letting the container to grow all the way down.
